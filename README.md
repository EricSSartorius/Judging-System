# U-Judge
### What is U-Judge?
U-judge, or Universal Judge, is an online judging system that can be used to judge any kind of events that requires a judge. 

The judging system is still in in beta, so currently the only type of event that can be judged follows the same format as a figure skating or skateboarding competition. Players take turns one by one performing during a timed round and judges input their scores accordingly. In the future, the ability to create and judge 1v1 or team vs team matches, among other custom features will also be implemented.

So how does this all work? Upon signing in and creating an event, the admin can then assign judges to their event. These judges can be anywhere in the world as long as they are connected to the net. If your judges are lazy they can even judge your event via Skype while sitting at home.

U-Judge 1.0 should be finished very shortly so stay tuned for deployment!

					<p>UJudge is a completely free online judging system that can be customized to meet your event needs. With the ability to keep track and manage all your event details, UJudge will turn your backyard skateboard competition into the next X-Games.</p>
					<p>We are currently in beta but feel free to create an account so that you can make a competition and try to judge it. Currently the only type of event that can be judged follows the format of a figure skating or skateboarding competition. Players take turns one by one performing during a timed round and judges input their scores accordingly. In the future, the ability to create and judge 1v1 or team vs team matches, among other custom features will also be implemented so stay tuned!</p>

					<p>Setting up an event could never be easier. After setting up your time limit and rounds, just add players and judges and you are good to go! Don't forget that the judges for your event are linked to the email address they made an acount with.</p>

					<p>Next you are ready to run your event! Just select the event you created and start the timer. Now you can sit back and watch the players as the judges do their job. And if you are really shorthanded you can even judge and admin the event at the same time.</p>

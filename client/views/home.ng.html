<h3>U-Judge is still in Beta so excuse the frequent updates!</h3>
<p>I am currently in the middle of a UI overhaul but feel free to create an account so that you can make a competition and try to judge it. Or if you don't want to create an account, <a ui-sref="quickScoreboard">Quick Scoreboard</a> is available without login.</p>
<p>Currently the only type of event that can be judged follows the format of a figure skating or skateboarding competition. Players take turns one by one performing during a timed round and judges input their scores accordingly. In the future, the ability to create and judge 1v1 or team vs team matches, among other custom features will also be implemented.</p>
